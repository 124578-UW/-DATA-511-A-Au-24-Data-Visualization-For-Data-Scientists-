# Data Visualization for Data Science – Course Repo

This repo documents my work for a data visualization course focused on using visual analytics to make sense of complex, real-world data. Over the quarter I learned how to take raw data, clean and structure it, and then design visualizations that actually help people understand what is going on.

At the end, I built an interactive dashboard that presents the results of a deeper data analysis for a non-technical audience.

## What This Course Was About (in my own words)

Modern organizations collect an overwhelming amount of data. This class was about what happens **after** you have all that data: how to turn it into visual stories and analytical tools that humans can understand and act on.

We focused on:

- How different **data types** map onto different **visual encodings**
- Why some charts help people see patterns and others just confuse them
- How to use **Python** and data tools to clean, transform, and combine datasets
- How to design both **static** and **interactive** visualizations
- How to build **dashboards** that guide users through an analysis
- How to think about **users**, perception, and human-computer interaction when designing visualizations

There was no final exam. Instead, the main deliverable was a **group project** and a final dashboard.

## What I Learned

By the end of the course, I learned how to:

- Explain **why** data visualization is critical in data science, not just a “nice-to-have”
- Choose appropriate **visual encodings** (position, color, size, shape, etc.) for different kinds of data
- Take messy data from common sources (CSVs, APIs, databases) and structure it for visual analysis
- Use Python for **data engineering** tasks like cleaning, transforming, and aggregating data
- Design and critique visualizations based on **clarity, accuracy, and user needs**
- Build **interactive visualizations and dashboards** that support exploration and guided analysis
- Present complex analysis results to a **non-technical audience** in a way they can actually understand

## Weekly Topics (Quick Summary)

Here is how the course content roughly unfolded:

### Week 1 – Why Data Visualization? Data Types and Visual Mappings
I learned the basic vocabulary of data (categorical, ordinal, quantitative, temporal) and how those map to things like position, color, and shape in a chart.

### Week 2 – Visual Encodings & Graphical Excellence, Visual Analytics Software
We looked at what “good” and “bad” visualizations look like and how visual analytics tools can speed up exploration.

### Week 3 – Data Sources & Structures, Python for Data Engineering
This week was about getting the data into shape: cleaning, wrangling, and structuring it so that it is ready for visualization.

### Week 4 – Exploratory Analysis, Multivariate Data, Interactivity
I practiced using visuals for **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, especially with multivariate data and basic interaction (filtering, tooltips, brushing).

### Week 5 – More Multivariate Visualizations, Project Selection
We went deeper into multivariate displays and started choosing datasets and topics for the final project.

### Week 6 – Advanced Visualization: ML, Trees & Networks, Five Design Sheets
We explored visualizing machine learning models and more complex structures like trees and networks, plus the Five Design Sheets method for planning visualizations.

### Week 7 – Project Definition & Design, Guided Dashboards
This was about scoping the project, defining questions, and starting to design a guided analytical dashboard.

### Week 8 – Testing, Feedback, Dashboards Part II
We worked on user feedback, refinement, and iteration on the dashboard and its interactions.

### Week 9 – Conclusion & Project Showcase
We presented our final projects and reflected on the design decisions and tradeoffs we made.

## Final Project & Dashboard

For the final project, I worked with a real dataset and went through the full pipeline:

1. **Data selection & problem framing**  
   - Chose a dataset and identified core questions we wanted to answer.

2. **Data preparation**  
   - Cleaned, transformed, and joined data sources using Python.

3. **Exploratory analysis**  
   - Used visualizations to explore patterns, outliers, and trends.

4. **Design & prototyping**  
   - Sketched multiple visualization ideas (inspired by the Five Design Sheets approach).
   - Evaluated different chart types and interaction patterns.

5. **Dashboard implementation**  
   - Built an interactive dashboard to guide a non-technical audience through the insights.
   - Focused on clear narrative, consistent encodings, and intuitive controls.

6. **Presentation & write-up**  
   - Summarized key findings and design choices in a report.
   - Presented the dashboard and explained the main insights.
